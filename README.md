# Soil Acoustics

This repository hosts the complete Markdown source code for the textbook **"Soil Acoustics"**, authored by **Leo Liu**. The book is designed as a self-contained educational resource for engineers, researchers, and students aiming to gain an in-depth understanding of soil acoustics, vibration, and wave propagation in geotechnical and environmental engineering contexts.

## 📖 About the Book

**Soil Acoustics** provides a systematic introduction to the fundamentals and applications of acoustic and vibration phenomena in soils and geomaterials. The writing style follows that of Leo Liu’s previous works such as *Multiphysics in Soil Mechanics* and *Artificial Intelligence for Engineers: Basics and Implementations*. The content includes:

- Step-by-step theoretical derivations
- Practical worked examples with detailed solution procedures
- Numerical and analytical methods
- Real-world applications
- Hands-on exercises and case studies

The book is written entirely in Markdown for open collaboration and easy version control.
